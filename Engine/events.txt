The (Steampunk) Girl (appears after 2 games, Convgirl bit 0):
Girl: "Well, well, look who’s back! Haven’t seen your gears spinning in ages, mate!"
You: "Oh, you know, been tangled up in life’s cogs and wheels!"
Girl: "Hold onto your hat—some ginger whirlwind’s been smashing your records lately, leaving a trail of sparks!"
You: "Seriously?!"
Girl: "Oh, absolutely! You’ve got a fiery challenger on your hands—bet he’ll strut in later to stir the pot!"

The (Steampunk) Girl (Convgirl bit 1):
Girl: "Get out there and crank those record-breaking engines, you legend!"

The Capgirl (appears after 4 games, ConvCapgirl bit 0):
Capgirl: "Well, hotshot, what’s the word on the street with you today?"
You: "I’m doing alright, I guess."
Capgirl: "Ha! Just alright? Listen up—each game drops you one free continue daily, straight from the pro playbook!"
You: "Whoa, didn’t catch that one!"
Capgirl: "Smart move? Save it for your killer run—trust me, it’s gold advice!"

The Capgirl (ConvCapgirl bit 2, set if gamesplayed > 6):
Capgirl: "You’re absolutely obliterating it out there, superstar!"
You: "Oh, thanks, that’s cool!"
Capgirl: "Hold the phone—I spotted a recruiter prowling around this morning!"
You: "A recruiter? What’s the deal?"
Capgirl: "Yeah, that ginger guy’s been shattering records, and it’s drawn some big-shot attention—watch out!"

The Capgirl (ConvCapgirl bit 3):
Capgirl: "Rumor has it there’s a hidden backroom with a mind-blowing game! Nail an average score above 80% across all games, 
and you’re in. Exclusive access, baby!"

The Gingerboy (appears after 8 games):
Gingerboy: "Check this out—my average score’s a slick 75%! Pretty epic, huh?"
You: "Whoa, that’s insane!"
Gingerboy: "You bet! Snagged a recruiter’s eye, and he’s hyping this backroom game—beat it, and it’s a ticket to some 
top-secret government gig. I’m on fire!"
