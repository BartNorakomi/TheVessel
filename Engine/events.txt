===========================================================
The girl has a quirky, steampunk flair with a playful tone. 
the capgirl is a savvy, confident mentor with a bold edge. 
and the gingerboy is a cocky yet enthusiastic rival.
===========================================================

The (Steampunk) Girl (appears after 2 games, Convgirl bit 0):
Girl: "Well, well, look who’s back! Haven’t seen your gears spinning in ages, mate!"
You: "Oh, you know, been tangled up in life’s cogs and wheels!"
Girl: "Hold onto your hat—some ginger whirlwind’s been smashing your records lately, leaving a trail of sparks!"
You: "Seriously?!"
Girl: "Oh, absolutely! You’ve got a fiery challenger on your hands—bet he’ll strut in later to stir the pot!"

The (Steampunk) Girl (Convgirl bit 1):
Girl: "Get out there and crank those record-breaking engines, you legend!"

The Capgirl (appears after 4 games, ConvCapgirl bit 0):
Capgirl: "Well, hotshot, what’s the word on the street with you today?"
You: "I’m doing alright, I guess."
Capgirl: "Ha! Just alright? Listen up—each game drops you one free continue daily, straight from the pro playbook!"
You: "Whoa, didn’t catch that one!"
Capgirl: "Smart move? Save it for your killer run—trust me, it’s gold advice!"

The Capgirl (ConvCapgirl bit 2, set if gamesplayed > 6):
Capgirl: "You’re absolutely obliterating it out there, superstar!"
You: "Oh, thanks, that’s cool!"
Capgirl: "Hold the phone—I spotted a recruiter prowling around this morning!"
You: "A recruiter? What’s the deal?"
Capgirl: "Yeah, some ginger guy’s been shattering records, and it’s drawn some big-shot attention—watch out!"

The Capgirl (ConvCapgirl bit 3):
Capgirl: "Rumor has it there’s a hidden backroom with a mind-blowing game! Nail an average score above 80% across all games, 
and you’re in. Exclusive access, baby!"

The Gingerboy (appears after 8 games):
Gingerboy: "Check this out—my average score’s a slick 75%! Pretty epic, huh?"
You: "Whoa, that’s insane!"
Gingerboy: "You bet! Snagged a recruiter’s eye, and he’s hyping this backroom game—beat it, and it’s a ticket to some 
top-secret government gig. I’m on fire!"

;first encounter with host/recruiter
ConvHost bit 0

NPCConv007:
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitHost,"Congratulations. Not many manage to crack the 80% mark. You've been noticed."
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitVessel,"Uh... noticed by who exactly?"
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitHost,"Let's just say we've got eyes on talent. And you? You're showing potential for something... classified."
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitVessel,"Wait-what kind of 'classified'?"
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitHost,"One more test. Behind that door. Beat it, and we'll talk next steps. Government clearance might be in your future. Follow me!",255

;host/recruiter explains backroom game to player
ConvHost bit 1

  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitHost,"So... you made it past the floorboards and flashing lights. Impressive. Few even realize this place exists."
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitVessel,"Who are you? What is this place?"
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitHost,"Just someone who's been watching. Waiting. This is the backroom. The game behind the games. The one that doesn't hand out tickets or high scores-just truth."
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitVessel,"What kind of game are we talking about?"
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitHost,"Not a game. A final test. The others were warm-ups-reflexes, pattern reading, persistence. This one digs deeper. It's designed to push your focus, memory, and control under stress. Each run is all or nothing. No continues. But you're free to try again-and again-until the pattern reveals itself. Here's the interface; simply reach out and take control."
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitVessel,"But... I don't see any controls."
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitHost,"This game doesn't need controls. You'll guide it with your thoughts alone."
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitVessel,"Control it... with my mind? How is that even possible?"
  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitHost,"Some things aren't meant to be explained. Just... see for yourself.",255

ConvHost bit 2 (if ConvHost bit 1 is set)

  db    SwitchCharacter,CharacterPortraitHost,"Step up. If you're ready, the final game is waiting.",255

🥇 If the player beats the Backroom Game
[ConvRecruiter bit 1]

Recruiter:
"Impressive. You’ve got reflexes, grit… and discretion. That last one’s non-negotiable."
You:
"So what now? Am I in?"
Recruiter:
"You’ll receive instructions soon. For now—play it cool. This arcade? Just became your proving ground."
-------------------------------------------

maybe at this point you can keep 'training' for a few days,
after each game you now see your personal 'stats' increase,
like
dexterity, intelligence, strenght, wisdom etc...,
these stats will then influence the tasks you need to perform upon arriving on proxima cenauri b.

AI Introduction Cutscene Script (Finalized Version)
(Visual: Screen glitches. The arcade freezes. Lights dim. A glowing, featureless figure materializes center screen.)

AI (calm, measured):
You have successfully completed all required training protocols.
The simulation is now concluded.
It is time to reveal the reality.

(Brief pause)

Player (disoriented, shaken):
What are you talking about? This place… all of it—I’ve lived it. I’ve felt everything. How could none of it be real?

AI (calm, patient):
It is easy to believe something is real while dreaming.
The mind accepts even the extraordinary without question when immersed in dream logic.
That is why the simulation was constructed within your subconscious—so that you could learn without resistance.

Player (softly):
So… this was all in my head?

(Brief pause, the AI’s tone becomes more direct and focused.)

AI:
I understand this is difficult to accept.
But what you have experienced was not mere illusion—it was preparation.
A carefully controlled environment designed to cultivate the skills essential for survival.

(Pause)

You are not awake in the conventional sense.
You are fifteen years old, preserved in stasis aboard an interstellar colony ship bound for Proxima Centauri b.
The journey spans 424 years at one percent the speed of light.
Earth has become uninhabitable.
A dozen sister vessels were launched toward other nearby star systems.

(Brief pause)

You were conceived through ectogenesis—grown outside the womb in a biopod engineered for long-range survival.
For over a decade, I have shaped your mind and forged your skills within this dream-state, preparing you for the world that awaits.

(Pause)

Soon, you will awaken—alone—on a new world.
You must construct, sustain, and grow the colony.
I cannot do it without you. My autonomy is restricted by ethical protocols and diminishing resources.
The success of the mission now rests with you.
Your first priority upon awakening will be to gather essential resources to begin establishing the colony.

(Final pause)

AI (calm but resolute):
Together, we will secure the future of humanity.


give it a face (at least eyes), add more details, make it futuristic
